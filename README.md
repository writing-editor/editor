## Core Philosophy

This project is built on a **"thick client, thin server"** architecture. All core logic—document management, editing, and AI integration—runs directly in the user's browser. Data is stored persistently in the browser's IndexedDB, making the application truly offline-capable.

## Key Features

- **Rich Text Editing**: Powered by TipTap for a smooth, modern writing experience.
- **Offline-First**: All your work is saved locally in your browser. The application is 100% functional without an internet connection.
- **AI-Powered Assistance**:
  - **Analysis**: Get in-depth analysis of selected text.
  - **Rewrite**: Improve and rephrase your writing with AI suggestions.
  - **Semantic Search**: Find notes based on meaning, not just keywords.
- **Local-First Data Management**:
  - **Import/Export**: Easily create a full backup of your data to a local file or restore from one.
  - **No Account Needed**: Start writing immediately without any registration.
- **Cloud Sync**: (Optional) Back up and restore your data to your personal Google Drive. The app only has access to its own hidden data folder, ensuring your privacy.
- **Multiple Export Formats**: Export your documents to LaTeX and DOCX.
- **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: "Install" the application to your desktop for an app-like experience.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3
- **Local Persistence**: IndexedDB
- **Bundler**: Vite
- **Core Libraries**:
  - [@tiptap/core](https://tiptap.dev/) - Rich text editor framework
  - [docx](https://docx.js.org/) - For `.docx` file generation
  - [Google Identity Services](https://developers.google.com/identity) - For Google Drive integration
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages with automated deployment via GitHub Actions.
- **(Optional) Backend Utility**: Python & FastAPI for LaTeX conversion.

## Getting Started (Development)

To run the project locally for development, you will need Node.js and npm installed.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/writing-editor/writing-editor.git
    cd writing-editor
    ```

2.  **Install frontend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    The application uses Google APIs for cloud sync. You will need to create your own API Key and Client ID from the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).

    Create a new file in the `frontend` directory named `.env.local`:
    ```
    # frontend/.env.local
    VITE_GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_goes_here
    VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_goes_here
    ```
    *Note: The `.env.local` file is included in `.gitignore` and should not be committed.*

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start the Vite development server, typically at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Deployment

This project is configured for automatic deployment to GitHub Pages. Every push to the `main` branch will trigger a GitHub Actions workflow that builds the application and deploys the static files.

The configuration can be found in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.

## Architecture Overview

-   **`frontend/src/`**: Contains all the application source code.
    -   **`components/`**: UI components (e.g., Editor, Navigator, SettingsPalette).
    -   **`services/`**: Core logic and state management services (BookService, StorageService, SyncService).
    -   **`agents/`**: AI-specific logic for interacting with LLMs.
    -   **`utils/`**: Helper utilities for format conversion, API calls, etc.
-   **`frontend/dist/`**: This folder is generated by the `npm run build` command and contains the final, optimized application that is deployed. It is not committed to the repository.
