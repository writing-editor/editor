Editor App is a distraction-free, local-first writing environment for authors and researchers. It combines a minimalist text editor with a powerful suite of integrated AI agents, a personal knowledge base, and robust data management features.

Built as both a **Progressive Web App (PWA)** for seamless offline browser use and a **cross-platform Desktop App** via Electron, it ensures your work is always available, secure, and under your control.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### ‚úçÔ∏è Core Writing Experience
*   **üìö Interactive Document Outline:** Organize your work into Books, Chapters, and Sections. The Navigator pane provides a live, clickable table of contents‚Äîjust like a PDF reader‚Äîallowing you to see your document's structure at a glance and navigate complex projects effortlessly.
*   **Distraction-Free Editor:** A clean, minimalist writing pane powered by Tiptap, with a bubble menu for essential formatting and Markdown-like slash commands.
*   **Contextual Scrollbar:** A unique scrollbar that shows your document's structure and allows for quick navigation between sections.

### ü§ñ AI-Powered Assistance
*   **Multi-Provider Support:** Configure the app with your own API keys for **Google Gemini**, **Anthropic Claude**, or a **Local LLM (Ollama)**.
*   **Agent-Based System:** The AI is powered by "Agents"‚Äîreusable, task-specific prompts.
    *   **Core Agents:** Comes with built-in agents for rewriting, analysis, brainstorming, and more.
    *   **Agent Manager:** Edit, disable, or **create your own AI agents** directly from the settings UI. Customize their prompts, triggers (e.g., show in bubble menu), and output handlers (e.g., replace text, create a new note).

### üß† Integrated Knowledge Management
*   **Notebook:** A dedicated space for capturing thoughts, research notes, and fleeting ideas, separate from your main documents.
*   **Advanced Note Search:**
    *   **Local Search:** Instantly search your notes with a high-performance, local full-text search engine.
    *   **AI "Deep" Search:** Perform semantic, concept-based searches on your notes using the `core.find_notes` agent.
*   **Automatic Tagging:** An optional background agent (`core.autotag`) can intelligently analyze your untagged notes and suggest relevant conceptual tags.

### üíæ Data Management & Portability
*   **Local-First Storage:** All data is stored reliably in your browser's IndexedDB, making the entire application fully functional offline.
*   **Google Drive Sync:** Optionally sign in with a Google account to sync your work across devices. The system is designed to be robust and protect your data.
*   **Intelligent Conflict Resolution:** The sync engine protects your work.
    *   Non-overlapping changes are merged automatically in the background.
    *   If a complex conflict is detected, a clean, **line-by-line contextual diff** appears, allowing you to choose which version to keep. **Your work is never silently overwritten or lost.**
*   **Backup & Restore:** Export your entire local database to a single `.json` file, or import a backup to restore your work on any machine.
*   **Multiple Export Formats:** Export individual documents to standard formats, including **LaTeX (.tex)** and **Microsoft Word (.docx)**.

### üé® Customization
*   **Theming:** Choose between clean light and dark themes.
*   **Editor Fonts:** Customize the editor's font family (Serif, Sans-Serif, Mono) and font size for a comfortable writing experience.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later recommended)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (or yarn/pnpm)

### Development Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd editor-app
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    This application uses Google APIs for authentication and cloud sync. You will need to create a project in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).

    Create a file named `.env` in the project root and add your credentials:
    ```.env
    # Get from your Google Cloud Console project
    VITE_GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY"

    # Get from the "OAuth 2.0 Client IDs" section (Web client)
    VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID.apps.googleusercontent.com"
    ```
    > **Note:** The AI provider API keys (for Gemini or Claude) are **not** set here. They are configured within the application's settings UI after it is running.

4.  **Run the App:**

    *   **For the Web App (PWA):**
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```
        The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

    *   **For the Desktop App (Electron):**
        ```bash
        npm run electron:dev
        ```
        This will launch Vite and Electron concurrently, with hot-reloading for the UI.

*   **Documentation:** Improve this README or add more detailed guides.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture

The application is built with **vanilla JavaScript (ES Modules)**, prioritizing simplicity, performance, and a clear, decoupled architecture.

*   **Controller Pattern:** `src/App.js` acts as the central orchestrator, initializing services and UI components. It passes a `controller` object to them, which serves as a public API for decoupled communication.
*   **Service-Oriented:** Core logic is encapsulated in services (`BookService`, `StorageService`, `SyncService`, `AgentService`).
*   **Local-First:** `StorageService` provides a robust wrapper around IndexedDB, ensuring the application is always responsive and works offline. `SyncService` builds on top of this to provide optional cloud backup.
*   **Component-Based UI:** The UI is broken down into plain JavaScript components, each managing its own piece of the DOM and logic without a heavy framework dependency.

## A Note on Development

This app was developed through vibecoding and with the extensive use of LLMs as a pair-programming partner, exploring a modern, AI-assisted development workflow.
